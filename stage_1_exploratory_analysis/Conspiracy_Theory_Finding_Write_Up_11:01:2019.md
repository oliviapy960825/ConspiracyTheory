# Conspiracy Theory Finding Write Up
# 11/1

----- 

## After getting rid of the keywords used by social feed manager and print out the most common unigram, bigram and trigram, we did see some pretty interesting overlaps:
 

### In unigram, the most common words include people/users like realdonaldtrump, healthranger, realgeoengwatch, bayleeb79, azskywatcher and etc., while Youtube is also often mentioned, and conspiracy, climatechange and etc words are also highly mentioned

----- 

### In bigram, there started to show up some combinations of usernames like "trishadishes healthranger", "healthranger naomirwolf" and etc, plus phrases like "proven real", "stop climatechange" "globalwarming haox", "big pharma" "maga realdonaldtrump" "humantrafficking wwg1wga", "qanon humantrafficking", some of which seems to have no direct relationships logically speaking with chemtrails. But those are the highly mentioned/used bigrams in chemtrail related tweets

----- 

### Trigrams show the same trends

----- 

### Then I moved forward and did some topic modeling and found that in the top 20 topics, words like abortion, shooting (gun/firearm), scotref/freescotland, vaccines and etc showed up, which made no sense at all logically speaking, and we want to know more about what exactly are the people's motivation behind the chemtrail tweets/conspiracy theories 
----- 

### Then I moved forward and got a list of people who are tweeting the most and the number of their followers, friends, and the number of their tweets

----- 

### I also moved forward and got a list of the most-RT-ed people within our sample and the number of their followers(unfortunately twitter objects do not have a count of total times being RT-ed attribute, so this might need better sampling method if we were to make more accurate judgements/observations)

----- 

### I also got a list of people who are mentioned the most and the number of times they are mentioned within our sample (This also might need better sampling method if we were to make more accurate cliams/judgements)

----- 

### I also got a list of URLs that were RT-ed the most within our sample, and url analyzing tool did warn us that there were malware embedded in some of them

----- 


# The Next Steps:

### Use virustotal to scan the urls and see how many of the most commonly retweeted ones are malicious, also record the original author of the tweets containing the urls. what's the content associated with malware that's different from other contents

----- 

### Check out the list of known state sponsored bots and see what they are sharing that are different from other people on twitter- dataset: recode;fivethirtyeight;twitter;nbcnews datasets

----- 

### Get a list of hashtags, look into which accounts use which hashtags and cluster the accounts by hashtags
-----

### We can use the same method to look at different conspiracy theory.
### Use bigram and trigram in LDA

### After the above steps we might want to think about in which direction we want to dive deeper into, in which case sampling method might be something to think about
